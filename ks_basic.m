%         This Program first creates a short 
%         white noise passed through dynamic filter
%         and then performs the Karplus-Strong 
%         Algorithm to produce a harmonic structure similar
%         to that of a plucked string

%Simulation Parameters
 
%s = rng(0);                % To Produce a fixed set of random numbers each time for a consistent tone

Fs = 44100;                 % Sample Rate Fs (samples/s)
f0 = 500;                   % Fundamental frequency (Hz)

N = round(Fs/f0 - 0.5);     % Delay line length (samples)

rho = 0.999;                % Loss Factor
R = 0.5;                    % Dynamics filter coefficient

dur = 2;                    % Length of simulation (s) 

M = round(Fs*dur);          % Length of simulation in samples

 
%%%%%%%%%%% ---- Pre-filter -----%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

v = 2*rand(N+1,1)-1;        % Input noise vector

u = filter((1-R),[1,-R],v); % Dynamics filter output

%% For loop to calculate rest of y using the recursion 
for n = N+1:M-1
    
    y(n+1) = (rho/2)*(y(n+1-N) + y(n-N));
